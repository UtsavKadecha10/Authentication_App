This is a Project that covers the functionalities and aspects of Node.js where we use APIs for backend, ReactJs for the frontend and MySQL for the database.

- To start with it has a Login or SignIn page where only authorized user gets the access to the information present in database.
- I used middleware where concept of cookies is applied for authentication purpose
- Then the after loging in the user can access the Data as displayed on the webpage.
- User can further logout once data has been accessed
